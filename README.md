GERMAN CREDIT CARD RISK PREDICTION | PYTHON | MACHINE LEARNING | POWER BI
HLO EVERYONE IAM EXITED TO SHARE MY FIRST MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT 

PROBLEM STAEMENT
Given demographic and financial information about individuals applying for loans, develop a predictive model to assess the 
risk associated with granting a loan to an applicant. The model should consider factors such as age, sex, job status, housing situation, savings and checking account balances,
credit amount, loan duration, and loan purpose to predict whether an applicant poses a low or high risk for defaulting on the loan.

APPROCHES USED
1)Identify problem statement
2)Analyse the data set(EDA)
3)Clean the data, remove outliers(EDA)
4)visualization(EDA)
6)building Machine learning model
7)model testing, compare evaluate optimization
8)optimization with hyperparameter tuning technique
9)Build evaluated model test it
10)Build final model.
11)conclusion.
